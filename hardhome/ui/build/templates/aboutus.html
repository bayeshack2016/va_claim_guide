Its first product was first created in March 2016 at <a href="http://bayeshack.org">BayesHack 2016</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.bayesimpact.org/">Bayes Impact</a>.</p><p>What started as a prototype won the BayesHack 2016 Veteran Affairs division and won 2nd place overall.
From the many enthusiastic reactions and support from the community, Jeff and Aaron decided to continue the project and use their talents to innovate tools for veterans and service members.</p></div><div class="team-wrapper"><h3>Our Founders</h3><div class="card-wrapper container-fluid"><div class="row"><div class="profile-wrapper col-sm-3"><div class="profile-back"><div class="profile-pic jeff"></div></div></div><div class="content-wrapper col-sm-9"><h4>Jeffrey Quinn</h4><p>Jeff is currently a Data Engineer at the health startup company, <a href="https://www.nuna.com/">Nuna</a>.
